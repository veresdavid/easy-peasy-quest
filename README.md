# Easy Peasy Quest

Easy Peasy Quest is a lightweight, short RPG game, made without any game engine, only using C++ and SFML as a dependency (maybe other helpful dependencies will be added later).
The purpose of this project is to sharpen a little bit my rusty C++ skills and to get a better understanding about game development.
More details will come later!

## Project dependencies

- SFML 2.5.1 ([https://www.sfml-dev.org/](https://www.sfml-dev.org/))

## Setting up the project locally - Windows, Visual Studio 2019

- Clone this repository
- Inside the solution directory, create a new directory, called `Dependencies` (this directory is excluded via `.gitignore`)
- Create a subfolder under `Dependencies`, called `SFML`
- Download SFML and extract the archived files content under the `Dependencies\SFML` folder (so this folder should contain the `bin`, `include`, etc. folders)
- Now you should be able run the project both in Release and Debug mode
